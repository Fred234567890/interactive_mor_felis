Interestingly the technique of sampling at the highest residual is similar to an adaptive Gram-Schmidt method. A faster and more uniform convergence may be achieved, if the samples would be taken at the frequencies of highest expected improvement.

This first due to the large number of calls (8 000) and their subfunctions (80 000), second, because in each call a sparse vector is cast into a dense one, and third, because surprisingly the transpositions are costly.
